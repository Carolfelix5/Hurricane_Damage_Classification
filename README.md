# Hurricane Damage Classification

## Overview
Hurricane Damage Classification is a deep learning-based project that categorizes images into "Damage" and "No Damage" classes. The project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to analyze disaster-affected areas from images.

## Features
- Uses image datasets of damaged and non-damaged areas
- Preprocesses images for effective learning
- Implements a CNN model for classification
- Evaluates model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn scikit-image
```

## Model
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Uses image resizing and data augmentation techniques.
- Performance evaluated using confusion matrix and classification metrics.

## Results
- The model classifies images into "Damage" and "No Damage" with high accuracy.
- Can be used for disaster response and recovery planning.
